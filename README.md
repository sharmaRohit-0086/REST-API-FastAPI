# REST-API-FastAPI
In this project, weâ€™ll create a user management system using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy as object relational mapping (ORM) to handle database operations. SQLAlchemy, a popular Python ORM, will manage the interaction with the database.

The user management system will provide a comprehensive set of API endpoints to allow users to perform everyday tasks such as adding a new user, updating user information, fetching user details, and deleting user accounts.

The user management system will be integrated with a DBMS to allow for seamless storage and retrieval of user data. SQLAlchemy will manage database operations, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and deleting records, and querying the database.

The error-handling mechanisms will be implemented to ensure the reliability and fault tolerance of the API. Also, thorough testing and debugging will be conducted to identify and resolve issues before deployment.
